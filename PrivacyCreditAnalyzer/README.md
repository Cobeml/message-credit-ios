## Core Data Models

### Message
Represents a single iMessage with validation and sanitization capabilities.

### PersonalityTraits
Encapsulates Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) with confidence scoring.

### TrustworthinessScore
Contains trustworthiness analysis with contributing factors and explanations.

### AnalysisResult
Complete analysis combining personality traits and trustworthiness scoring with metadata.

### SignedResult
Cryptographically signed analysis result for verification and backend storage.

## Features

- **Privacy-First**: All message processing happens on-device
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All data models include validation and error handling
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Results are signed for authenticity
- **Extensive Testing**: Full unit test coverage for all data models
- **SwiftUI Interface**: Modern iOS interface with debugging capabilities

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

## Bundle Identifier

`com.privacycreditanalyzer.app`

## Implementation Status

✅ **Task 1 Complete**: iOS project structure and core data models
- Created Swift Package Manager project structure
- Implemented all 5 core data models with full validation
- Added comprehensive unit tests (22 tests, all passing)
- Established proper bundle identifier and capabilities

## Next Steps

This foundation enables implementing the remaining tasks:
1. Message input and parsing functionality
2. MLX-Swift integration for on-device AI inference
3. Background processing for large message volumes
4. Cryptographic signing with CryptoKit
5. PostgreSQL backend communication
6. Enhanced UI with debugging features

## Testing

Run the unit tests to verify all data models work correctly:

```bash
swift test
```

All models include comprehensive validation, serialization, and error handling tests.

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Message validation and sanitization
- ✅ PersonalityTraits range clamping and validation
- ✅ TrustworthinessScore factor analysis
- ✅ AnalysisResult dictionary conversion
- ✅ SignedResult cryptographic structure
- ✅ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

All 22 tests pass successfully.
