## Comparative Analysis

### 📈 Key Differences

| Metric | Responsible User | Irresponsible User | Gap |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Overall Trustworthiness** | 80.9% | 29.0% | +51.9% |
| **Financial Responsibility** | 88.0% | 20.0% | +68.0% |

The MLX-based inference engine (with intelligent fallback) successfully identifies:

1. **Financial Patterns**: Budget mentions vs. overdraft complaints
2. **Emotional Stability**: Calm responses vs. volatile reactions  
3. **Relationship Quality**: Supportive messages vs. conflict indicators
4. **Planning Ability**: Proactive behavior vs. reactive scrambling
5. **Communication Style**: Clear expression vs. defensive language

### 🧪 For Development Testing

1. **Run Sample Analysis**:
   ```swift
   let runner = SampleAnalysisRunner()
   let results = try await runner.runSampleAnalysis()

2. **Load Specific Presets**:
   ```swift
   let manager = PresetDataManager()
   let messages = manager.loadPresetMessages(type: .responsibleUser)
   let expected = manager.loadExpectedResult(type: .responsibleUser)
   ```

3. **Compare Results**:
   ```swift
   let comparison = manager.compareResults(actual: result, expected: expected)
   print(comparison.summary) // "✅ Analysis accuracy: 96%"
   ```

## Summary

✅ **Complete sample datasets generated** with realistic financial behavior patterns
